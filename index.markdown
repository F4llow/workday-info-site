# Project Launch Page

Hey team! Nathaniel Callabresi is working on a project launch page for us, and I'm super excited about it. Phil had the idea to centralize a page similar to IT Links, when I asked him to vanity our Smartsheet app. I'd like to talk through what resources can be linked on the page now, knowing it will grow over time. Here were some of my ideas. What else?

## Resources

- [Link to Smartsheet](https://www.wm.edu)
- [Link to Workday Community](https://www.wm.edu)
- [Link to Training Repository](https://www.wm.edu) - I'll work on the link, as in, make it exist.
- [Direct link to the Project Teams Team](https://www.wm.edu) - Everything project related is being directed there.
- [Maybe a link to the Public-facing Project Website?](https://www.wm.edu)
- [Linkage to the Job Aid for Community Access or Posted Instructions](https://www.wm.edu)

Please let me know what else should be included or any other ideas you have!
